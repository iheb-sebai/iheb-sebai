# Hi there, I'm iheb sebai 👋

Hi there! 👋 I’m [Your Name], a passionate Software Developer with expertise in the MERN stack, Next.js, and Docker. I thrive on building scalable and efficient web applications.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing full-stack applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and enhancing my skills with Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- 🌱 I’m diving deeper into containerization with Docker to streamline development workflows and improve deployment processes.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects involving microservices architecture and cloud-native applications.
- 🤔 I’m interested in exploring new trends in web development, particularly around serverless architectures and DevOps practices.

- 🤝 I’m open to help with MERN stack challenges, Next.js features, or Docker best practices.
- 💬 Feel free to ask me about front-end development with React, backend services with Node.js, or how to containerize your applications with Docker.
